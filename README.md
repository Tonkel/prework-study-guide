# prework-study-guide

A study guide for pre-work, pretty self explanitory.

I built this project in order to store some notes that I found useful, which I could then reference later if needed.

I also built it so others can see my notes if they find them useful (which I doubt as a lot of my notes are written)

## Instalation
N/A

## Usage

To use this tool, inspect the page using dev tools by right clicking your mouse then scrolling down to inspect. Once there click the console tab to see what topics I learned and a random suggestion of what topic to study.

## How to contribute
Please make a pull request with any notes you would like to add and I will review it and approve/deny the request.

## Credits
Me :)
